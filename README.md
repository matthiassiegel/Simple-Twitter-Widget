Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### What could be the reason if the widget doesn't work?

The code has been extensively tested and most issues can be resolved by trying the following:

1. make sure your server / WordPress can connect to Twitter
2. check if your WordPress upload directory is writable. This is where the widget tries to store the cache file
3. try other public Twitter feeds
4. temporarily set the caching interval to a low value like 10 and see if it makes a difference.

Also keep in mind it will only work with public Twitter feeds, not private ones.
